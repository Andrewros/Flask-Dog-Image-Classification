# Flask-Dog-Image-Classification
This is a project that uses Image classification and Machine learning to detect 3 different dog types. This provided me insight into how you can make image classification neural networks and also how to deploy them with flask. You are able to see images that you can test the files on in the Images folder.
The packages that should be installed are torch torchvision flask and Pillow.
